### Localization :

* For translations will use here [get_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/get_cli)
* Create your language json files inside assets/locales folder as below:


    |- assets/
        |-locales/
            |- en.json
            |- gu.json
            |- hi.json


    - Here file name should be in the language code as defined above for English,Hindi and Gujarati.

* Define your whole app strings into this json files as per the language.

* To install get_cli execute below commands one by one:

1. dart pub global activate get_cli
2. flutter pub global activate get_cli

* Now will generate string keys using below command, that will generate locales.g.dart file inside
  out lib folder.

  get generate locales assets/locales

* After this define translationsKeys in our main app which is located inside main.dart.

        GetMaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          translationsKeys: AppTranslation.translations,
          locale: initialLocale,
          fallbackLocale: const Locale('en', 'US'),
          theme: ThemeData.light(),
          darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
          themeMode: initialThemeMode,
          getPages: AppRoutes.getPages,
          initialRoute: initialRoute,
        ),


* Now in whole app use translations string like this -> LocaleKeys.follow.tr:

        Text(LocaleKeys.follow.tr, 
            style: GoogleFonts.poppins(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: AppFontWeight.bold, color: AppColors.colorBlack)),


* So, here as written in above code AppTranslation & LocaleKeys this both are generated class
  and located inside lib/generated/locales.g.dart.
* Do not change anything inside this generated files, if you want to add new strings then you can
  add into your json files which are located inside assets/locales/ and then generate
  new LocaleKeys for that.
